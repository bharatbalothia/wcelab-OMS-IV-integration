# Sterling OMS IV Integration

## IV Quick Start with Postman

1. Install postman.
2. Import the "IV Quick Start Collection"
3. "Edit" the newly imported collection to check if the variables are correct
4. Create an environment for testing. You can name it anything that you like. You can keep it blank. It is for us to keep the bearer tokens for API calls.
4. Use "Runner" to run the "10 Get Bearer Tokens" folder. 
   1. ***Select the environment that you created or selected in the previous setp*** 
   1. ***Check the "Keep variable values" checkbox to save the tokens into the environment***
   1. Double check if environment now has value for variables such as ___bearerToken_supplies, bearToken_shipNodes___
