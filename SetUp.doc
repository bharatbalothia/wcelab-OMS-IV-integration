Prerequisites
1.	IBM JDK minimum version – 7.0.9.10 for both Sterling Order Management and WebSphere Application Server
2.	Install Sterling Order Management V9.5 and apply latest fix pack (FP26) 
3.	Onboard the tenants to the Inventory Visibility. Configure ship nodes, distribution groups, thresholds (if any) for the tenant(inv org that is going to be activated ).
4.	Get the tenant ID, client ID and client secret

Follow the above link for OMS-Inventory Visibility Integration.Below are the brief steps

Integration Steps
1.	Merge the sample templates of Inventory Visibility with the existing template files.

2.	Run the activation script for the inventory org  from the <INSTALL_DIR>/bin directory. Provide the enterprise code(inv org), client ID, client secret, tenant ID and logfile name 

Note: The inv org should already be present in the Sterling Order Management.

3.	Remove any start files (files with the extension .xml.restart) from the <INSTALL_DIR>/repository/factorysetup/iv_integration/install/ directory. 

4.	Add the queue connection properties in the customer_overrides.properties file (App and Agent)

5.	Build the resources jar from the <INSTALL_DIR>/bin directory.(irrespective of customer_overrides.properties path)

6.	Build EAR from the <INSTALL_DIR>/bin directory.

7.	The below services will be created when the inventory org is activated.

Under Applications Manager > Applications > Applications Platform (inventory org) > Process Modeling > General Repository > Service Definitions > Inventory Visibility Adapter

<inventory_org>_IVAdjustDemandAsynchronously
<inventory_org>_IVAdjustSupplyAsynchronously
<inventory_org>_IVAdjustDemandSynchronously
<inventory_org>_IVAdjustSupplySynchronously
<inventory_org>_IVSyncDemandService
<inventory_org>_IVSyncSupplyService
<inventory_org>_IVReadCachedAvailability

8.	From the Sterling configurator, enable the appropriate events to call actions and corresponding services.

•	To enable the events, from the Applications Manager, select Applications > Applications Platform (DEFAULT) > Process Modeling > General Repository > Transactions

•	To access the Inventory Change events, click Inventory Change > Events (DEFAULT)

•	Activate the DEMAND_CHANGE and SUPPLY_CHANGE_LIST events (DEFAULT)

•	To access the Inventory Snapshot events, click Inventory Snapshot > Events (DEFAULT)

•	Activate the DEMAND_SYNC and SUPPLY_SYNC events (DEFAULT)

•	Open the Applications Manager, select Applications > Applications Platform (<inventory_org>) > Process Modeling >  General Repository > Actions > Inventory Visibility Adapter

•	Add the Inventory Visibility Adapter > DemandChange action (<inventory_org>) to the above activated DEMAND_CHANGE event (DEFAULT)

•	Add the Inventory Visibility Adapter > SupplyChange action (<inventory_org>) to the above activated SUPPLY_CHANGE_LIST event (DEFAULT)

•	Add the Inventory Visibility Adapter > DemandSync action (<inventory_org>) to the above activated DEMAND_SYNC event (DEFAULT)

•	Add the Inventory Visibility Adapter > SupplySyncaction (<inventory_org>) to the above activated SUPPLY_SYNC event (DEFAULT)

9.	Configure the inventory snapshot agents.
•	Applications Manager, select Applications > Applications Platform (DEFAULT) > Process Modeling > General Repository > Transactions > Inventory Snapshot 
•	Under Time Triggered configure the INV_SUPPLY_SYNC and INV_DEMAND_SYNC criteria with agent name, connection and queue details.

	Testing Inventory Visibility APIs

	Adding SSL certificate

1.	Add the Inventory visibility SSL certificate to the Java keystore of OMS.
2.	Download the SSL certificate from https://eu-api.watsoncommerce.ibm.com/ using the Mozilla browser and save it with .crt extension
3.	Import the certificate to the OMS java keystore using the below command.(eg:-watsoncommerceibmcom.crt)
<oms_install_directory>/jdk/bin/keytool -import -alias watsoncert -keystore <oms_install_directory>/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file <certificate_directory>/-watsoncommerceibmcom.crt
4.	Provide the default password - changeit
5.	When prompted to trust the certificate, type ‘yes’
6.	Verify if the certificate is added properly using the below command.
echo 'changeit' | keytool -list -alias watsoncert -v -keystore $(find <oms_install_directory>/jdk -name cacerts) | grep 'Owner:'
7.	The output of the above command should be
Owner: CN=*.watsoncommerce.ibm.com, OU=Watson Customer Engagement, O=IBM Danmark Aps, L=Ballerup, C=DK
8.	If any synchronous calls are made from OMS to inventory instance, add the certificate to WebSphere Application Server Java keystore path by following the above steps. 

Adding Java TLS properties in startup scripts

1.	Add the below java properties in the startIntegrationServer.sh and startAgentServer.sh scripts of OMS
-Dcom.ibm.jsse2.overrideDefaultTLS=true
-Dhttps.protocols=TLSv1.2
-Djdk.tls.client.protocols=TLSv1.2
 

2.	For any synchronous calls, add the same properties in the java arguments of the WebSphere Application Server Console and restart the application server.
